# Simulated_Annealing_algorithm
SA test case

The purpose of this case study is to solve a 10-node Travel Salesman Problem (TSP): find the shortest tour which starts from node 1, visits 
each node once, and returns to node 1 with the shortest distance.

The distance matrix is provided below. This problem is symmetric so the distance from city i to city j is the same as that from city j and city i.
